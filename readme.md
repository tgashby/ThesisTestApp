> Test Application: Todo app with Express.js


[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/tgashby/ThesisTestApp/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/tgashby/ThesisTestApp/latest) < I always thought those were so cool.

This application will be used for trying different JS Testing frameworks. It was taken from [github.com/azat-co/todo-express](http://github.com/azat-co/todo-express).

I will be purposely breaking and fixing the code in an effort to make sure the tests are doing what they're supposed to.

Original, unaltered README:

This is an example of classical (no front-end JavaScript frameworks) web application built with Express.js 3.3.5.
The full source code is available at [github.com/azat-co/todo-express](http://github.com/azat-co/todo-express).
